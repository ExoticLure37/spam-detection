Overview
This project aims to detect email spam using logistic regression, a popular machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. The project utilizes a dataset of labeled emails, where each email is labeled as either spam or not spam (ham). Logistic regression is employed to build a predictive model that can classify new emails as spam or ham based on their features.

Features
Feature Engineering: The project involves extracting relevant features from the email dataset, such as word frequencies, presence of certain keywords, or other textual characteristics.
Logistic Regression: Logistic regression is applied to train a model using the extracted features. The logistic regression model learns to assign probabilities to each email being spam or ham.
Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps assess how well the model generalizes to unseen data and its effectiveness in classifying emails correctly.
Model Deployment: Once trained and evaluated, the model can be deployed to classify new incoming emails in real-time.

Dependencies

•	Usage

Steps:
Data Preparation: Prepare your dataset of labeled emails. Ensure that it includes features relevant for classification (e.g., word frequencies, presence of specific keywords).
Feature Engineering: Extract and preprocess features from the dataset. This may involve text preprocessing, such as tokenization, stemming, or removing stop words.
Model Training: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train a logistic regression model using the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing data. Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its performance.
